GitLab
======

``git`` is the command-line tool that stores committed versions of code to the
history of a repository. GitLab (and GitHub and Bitbucket) are websites to
which you can upload those repositories. They also offer lots of nice
collaboration tools, like issues, comments and merge requests for discussing
code.

In BSPC, we use GitLab to track our code. We run an instance of GitLab running
in the NICHD data center which is only accessible inside the NIH network. If
you have access to the NIH network and you are interested in accessing this
GitLab instance, contact ryan.dale@nih.gov for more info.

It's expected that you already know :ref:`git`.

For the basics of GitLab, the `GitLab tutorials
<https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/tutorials/>`__ have useful links to start with.

You can read more about the bigger picture of how we use git and GitLab in the
documention for `GitLab flow
<https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/topics/gitlab_flow.html>`_. While most of that page
is very useful information, we tend to use the simpler GitHub flow rather than
GitLab flow.
