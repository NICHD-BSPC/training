BSPC Training
=============

These pages are developed by NICHD's `Bioinformatics and Scientific Programming
Core (BSPC) <https://bioinformatics.nichd.nih.gov>`_ as a resource to help
train NICHD staff and fellows in various computational and bioinformatics
topics.

  Note: the opinions on these pages do not reflect those of NICHD or NIH.

There's a lot of excellent training material out there, so rather than repeat
it, this website acts as a central location of curated resources. We've found
the good stuff so you can get right to learning.

Start here
----------

Bioinformatics and scientific programming is a big field, and it can be
difficult to know where to start.

If you are at NIH, you can schedule a meeting (ryan.dale@nih.gov) to discuss
your training goals and expectations so we can help develop a customized
training plan.

Ready? Head to :ref:`first-steps`.
