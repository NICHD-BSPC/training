First steps
===========

The target audience of this site is trainees at NIH wanting to improve their
computational skills. This could be to make a career change, to boost your
marketability, to know what skills to hire for when you start your own lab,

For many trainees, it can be difficult to find the time to improve your
computational skills while also trying to maintain productivity in the lab.
Learning R or Python is literally learning a new language, requiring practice
and repeated exposure to pick it up.

Persistence and patience will be very important!

----------

The following three articles introduce general concepts and terminology, give
great advice for how to learn and ask questions, and get you in the right
mindset for learning bioinformatics and programming in general. They are about
learning how to learn, which is probably the most important single skill you
can have.

1. `Ten simple rules for biologists learning to program
   <http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005871>`_,
   a PLOS Computational Biology article.  It has the following
   rules:

   - begin with the end in mind
   - baby steps are steps
   - immersion is the best learning tool
   - phone a friend
   - learn how to ask questions
   - don't reinvent the wheel
   - develop good habits early on
   - practice makes perfect
   - teach yourself
   - just do it

   Make sure you read Fig 2 through Fig 5 carefully -- this is exactly the sort
   of puzzle you will encounter thousands of times throughout your programming
   career!

2. `So you want to be a computational biologist?
   <https://www.nature.com/articles/nbt.2740>`_, published in Nature
   Biotechnology. This is advice from two computational biologists on starting
   out on computational projects.

3. `How to be a wizard (at programming) <https://jvns.ca/wizard-zine.pdf>`_.
   This one is about how to ask experts the right kinds of questions, how to
   build expertise, and gaining the confidence to figure out answers that
   nobody knows. The illustrations take some getting used to, but the content
   is excellent and very important.

Next steps
----------
The next steps you take will depend on your learning goals.

**Start with** :ref:`command-line` if any of the following are true:

- you plan to run any sort of command-line bioinformatics tools
- you plan to use NIH's Biowulf high-performance computing cluster
- you would like to get experience using Linux
- you want to have a strong foundation before moving on to other topics


**Start with** :ref:`choosing-r-python` if you don't know which programming
language to learn first.

**Start with** :ref:`python` or :ref:`r` if you know what language you want to
learn first.

**Start with** :ref:`biology` if you are a computer scientist looking to learn more
biology.
