BSPC Training
=============

These pages are developed by NICHD's `Bioinformatics and Scientific Programming
Core (BSPC) <https://bioinformatics.nichd.nih.gov>`_ as a resource to help
train NICHD staff and fellows in various computational and bioinformatics
topics.

  Note: the opinions on these pages do not reflect those of NICHD or NIH.


Start here
----------

Bioinformatics and scientific programming is a big field, and it can be
difficult to know where to start.

If possible, schedule a meeting (ryan.dale@nih.gov) to discuss your training
goals and expectations so we can help develop a customized training plan.

There's a lot of excellent training material out there, so rather than repeat
it, this website acts as a central location of curated resources to help focus
your learning.

Ready? Head to :ref:`first-steps`.
