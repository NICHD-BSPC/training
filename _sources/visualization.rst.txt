Visualization
=============

-  `Data Visualization: A Practical Introduction <http://socviz.co/>`__
   A data visualization-centric approach to learning R. Also has some
   great discussions on what makes a plot good or bad (channeling a fair
   amount of Tufte in the process)

- `Fundamentals of Data Visualization <https://clauswilke.com/dataviz/>`_

- `A relatively succinct read on graphics design and thinking about how to plot
  things <https://socviz.co/lookatdata.html>`__ From an R-focused tutorial,
  also linked above.

- `Aggregation of many Points of View columns from Nature
  <http://blogs.nature.com/methagora/2013/07/data-visualization-points-of-view.html>`__

- `Stephen Few’s site <http://www.perceptualedge.com/>`__ Stephen Few thinks
  a lot about data presentation, and provides many examples of fixing
  not-so-great plots. See in particular the “Examples” section and the bottom
  of the “Library” section which has a large amount of PDF articles he’s
  written.

- `Friends don't let friends make bad graphs
  <https://github.com/cxli233/FriendsDontLetFriends>`_ is a very clear,
  succinct set of examples showing how to avoid various pitfalls that,
  unfortunately, show up in published papers all the time.

    Visualization topics needed:

    - genome browser screenshots
    - inkscape
    - Tufte-isms (chartjunk; data to ink ratio)
    - why not pie charts
    - colormaps (jet vs viridis)
    - colorblindness
