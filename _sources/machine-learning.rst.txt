Machine learning
================

This page is a collection of machine learning-related links.

- `Interpretable Machine Learning
  <https://christophm.github.io/interpretable-ml-book/>`_ an online book about
  making models explainable. In biology, often we want to use models to
  understand systems rather than blindly predict things about them, and
  intepretability of models is key to that.

- `Feature engineering and selection: a practical approach for predictive
  models <https://bookdown.org/max/FES/>`_

- `A visual introduction to machine learning
  <http://www.r2d3.us/visual-intro-to-machine-learning-part-1/>`_ A really nice
  demonstration of training a decision tree. This, and the second part on bias
  and variance, I think really capture the essence of machine learning.
