Biology
=======

Bioinformatics is a field at the intersection of biology and computer science.
Since we're at NIH, most of the time people already have biology knowledge and
want to learn more about the computational side. But there are many cases where
experts in computer science would like to learn biology.

The `Introduction to Genomics <http://compgenomr.github.io/book/intro.html>`_
chapter in "Computational Genomics with R" is quite good for getting up to
speed on biology.

From Khan Academy, `Eukaryotic gene regulation
<https://www.khanacademy.org/science/biology/gene-regulation/gene-regulation-in-eukaryotes/a/overview-of-eukaryotic-gene-regulation>`_
and `Eukaryotic transcription factors
<https://www.khanacademy.org/science/biology/gene-regulation/gene-regulation-in-eukaryotes/a/eukaryotic-transcription-factors>`_
are useful.

This 2015 review article on `high-throughput sequencing technologies
<https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1097276515003408>`_ is
slightly dated, but well-written.

Scitable
--------

The journal Nature has many high-quality ebooks used for undergraduate and
gradute students in its [Scitable](https://www.nature.com/scitable/) resource.

This site has lots of content, but it doesn't seem to be updated much. That's
OK; the basic biology parts are good. The genomics parts are a little out of
date though. Here, we extract out the parts that are directly relevant to the
kind of genomics work being done in BSPC.

.. note::

    The navigation in the Scitable pages is a little confusing -- it's easy to
    miss the distinction between subheadings for the current section and the
    headings for other section. Be sure to click through the subheadings in the
    right-side navigation to make sure you're seeing all the content.
