Algorithms
==========

This page is a general resource for various algorithm-related topics.


-  `Deep learning online book <http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/>`__

-  `Statistics vs machine learning
   <https://www.nature.com/articles/nmeth.4642>`__

-  `Animations of search path algorithms
   <https://bost.ocks.org/mike/algorithms>`__ Fun-to-watch demonstrations of
   maze path finding

-  `Sorting algorithm visualization <https://m.imgur.com/gallery/GD5gi>`__

-  `HDBSCAN clustering <http://hdbscan.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`__ The author
   makes a good case for why this is a good clustering algorithm

-  `Choosing a random number
   <https://twitter.com/colmmacc/status/1012719876706840578?s=11>`__ Really
   nice twitter thread on the perils of choosing random numbers. Itâ€™s not
   intuitive.

-  `A visual introduction to machine learning
   <http://www.r2d3.us/visual-intro-to-machine-learning-part-1/>`__ A really
   nice demonstration of training a decision tree. This, and the second part on
   bias and variance, I think really capture the essence of machine learning.
